# Alien Invasion Project

## General Purpose

This Project aims to deepen my understanding of OOP in Python.
To do so, I use pygame to create a space-invaders game.
Orienting myself on the book 'Python 3 Crashcourse' by Eric Matthes, which includes
a guide for this project for practising purpose, I aim to establish a new feature
when the game itself is (nearly) done.

## The Game

> *In Alien Invasion, the player controls a spaceship that appears in the center at the bottom of the screen. 
> The player can move the ship to the right and left using the arrow keys and fire projectiles using the space bar. 
> At the start of the game, a fleet of alien spaceships fills the sky and moves sideways and downwards on the screen. 
> The player shoots to destroy the enemy ships. When he has shot them all down, a new fleet appears, which moves faster than the previous one. 
> If an alien ship collides with the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. 
> If the player has lost three ships, the game ends.*
